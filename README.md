- 👋 Greetings, I go by the handle @aasgherali.
- 👀 My primary interest lies in the application of optimal control to continuous systems, utilizing numerical optimization algorithms.
- 🌱 Presently, my focus is on delving into gradient descent algorithms, particularly their application in addressing optimal control problems through direct or indirect methods.
- 💞️ I am enthusiastic about collaborative ventures involving numerical optimization and mathematical modeling, with a specific emphasis on deterministic models in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs).
- 📫 Feel free to get in touch with me via email at asgher_dot_ali_at_lums_dot_edu_dot_pk.
