- 👋 Hi, I’m @aasgher385
- 👀 I’m interested in optimal control applied to continous system using numerical optimization algorithms. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the gradient descent algorthims especially the use of direct or indirect methods to solving optimal control problems. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to numerical optimization and mathematical modeling (deterministic models especially PDEs). 
- 📫 You can reach me at my email address @asgher_dot_ali_at_lums_dot_edu_pk.
